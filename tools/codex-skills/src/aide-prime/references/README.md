# AIDE Prime Skill References

This skill is intentionally minimal and reads only:
- `AGENT_ORIENTATION.md`
- `AGENTS.md`

It locates the repo root by walking up from the current working directory until `AGENTS.md` is found.

Output format is a short Prime Report (<=10 lines) that confirms what was loaded and asks for the task spec or PR/issue link.
