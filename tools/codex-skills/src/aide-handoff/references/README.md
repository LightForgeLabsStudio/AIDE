# AIDE Handoff Skill References

This skill outputs a session handoff note, preferring the AIDE template at:

`.aide/docs/core/SESSION_HANDOFF.template.md`

If the template is missing, it falls back to a built-in version.

By default, it prints the handoff for PR/issue comments and does not write files.
