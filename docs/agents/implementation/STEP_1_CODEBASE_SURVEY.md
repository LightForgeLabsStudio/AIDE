# Implementation Agent - Step 1: Codebase Survey (Read Targeted)

**Navigation:** [Index](../IMPLEMENTATION_START.md) | Prev: [Step 0](STEP_0_SPEC_INTAKE.md) | Next: [Step 2](STEP_2_PLAN_AND_DRAFT_PR.md)

## Purpose
Read only what's needed to implement the spec, confirm constraints, and identify risks/dependencies before planning.

## Prerequisites
- Step 0 complete (spec intake + alignment questions handled).

## Step Actions

Read targeted:
- `{{GITHUB_QUERIES_DOC}}` - Query GitHub for related issues/epics and implementation status
- Spec-referenced pillars only (not all `{{PROJECT_DESIGN_DOCS}}`)
- `{{DEVELOPMENT_DOC}}` sections for involved systems
- `{{CODING_GUIDELINES_DOC}}` - Style

## Exit Criteria
- You can name the exact systems/files that will change.
- You can explain how the spec fits existing architecture (or what conflicts exist).
- Dependencies/risks are identified and, if needed, clarified on the issue before planning.
